                        <p>“My thinking is that if I can run for 50 kilometres, anything is on the table. Every time I push my limits on a run and reach either a distance or time goal, I’m teaching my brain that I can achieve things that are hard. The more it happens, the more I believe it, and in turn, I’m empowered to try even harder things.”</p>

                        <h4>What is a Good Interval Running Workout</h4>
                        <p>"Whereas steady-state running is about building the cardio engine, higher intensity training enables us to build strength and power, by stimulating both the aerobic and anaerobic systems. Interval workouts will improve your running by making you more efficient, working your coordination, and improving your endurance."</p>

                        <p>"This time has really got me realizing how many hours we really have in a day. I’ve always found it hard to find the time to read in the past. Since we’ve been in lockdown I’ve been able to read a bunch of books. I’m finding huge value in reading an hour or two (maybe three on the weekends!) before going to bed. I’m learning new things, indulging in new perspectives, and finally ticking off books that have been on my list for years. Reading is a great way to temporarily escape your reality and can help make a small apartment not feel so small after all."</p>
